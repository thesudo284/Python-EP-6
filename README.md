In Python, typecasting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is often useful when you need to perform operations on variables of different types or when you want to explicitly control the data type of a variable.

There are two types of typecasting:

Explicit Typecasting (also known as type conversion): This is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. For example:

python
num = 5.5
num_int = int(num)  # Converts the float 5.5 to the integer 5
Implicit Typecasting: This is done automatically by Python when it needs to convert one data type to another for compatibility during operations. For example:

python
result = 5 + 2.5  # The integer 5 is implicitly converted to a float, and the result is 7.5
Python makes typecasting simple and intuitive, but it’s always good to double-check to ensure you’re not losing any important data (like truncation when casting from a float to an integer). Let me know if you'd like examples or further clarification!
